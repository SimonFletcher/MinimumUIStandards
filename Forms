##Forms
In an enterprise application, forms will be the primary way that your users interact

- Labels should be grouped, visually, with their input fields.
- The tab key should move the focus through each input field on the form in a logical order:top to bottom and left to right.
- Make it obvious which field currently has focus.
- There should be a default action when the user hits the `Enter` key - and it should not be destructive.
