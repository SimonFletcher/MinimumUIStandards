## Forms
In an enterprise application, forms will be the primary way that your users interact which means that they have to enable the user to input data quickly and efficiently.

- Structure
  - Visually group related content.
  - Group labels with their input fields.
- Navigation
  - The tab key should move the focus through each input field on the form in a logical order:top to bottom and left to right.
  - Make it obvious which field currently has focus.
  - There should be a default action when the user hits the `Enter` key - and it should not be destructive.
- Input Fields - General
  - Use HTML Attributes to tell the browser what kind of data is being input
  -  Auto-complete, autofill
  - (Probably) turn off browser input validation
- Dropdown lists
  - Should display values sorted alphabetically, or numerically, as appropriate.
  - Should, if there are more than 8-10 values, provide an inline filter/autocomplete option.
- Numeric inputs
  - should not require anything other than the number itself, and any decimal separator, to be entered.
  - should not allow anything other than numeric values and the decimal separator to be entered.
  - should, ideally, display fully formatted values values when they do not have focus.
- Date inputs
  - should allow the date to be typed in - users should not be forced to use the mouse to select a date from some kind of calendar;
  - BUT should provide a calendar input;
  - AND that calendar input should enable the date to be selected using keyboard navigation.
- Buttons
  - should look like buttons.
  - the primary action, e.g. `Save`, should be obvious and the default action when if the user hits the `Enter` key.
  - the secondary action, e.g. `Cancel`, should be visually distinct from the primary action.
  - if there is a destructive action, e.g. `Delete`, it should be spatially separated from any primary or secondary actions.
- Default values
  - Only provide where
- Validation
  - Whenever possible, validate fields after the user has entered values.
- Errors
  - Should be displayed next to the fields to which they relate.
  - Should indicate what is wrong and, ideally, how to fix it.
