It seems that on every enterprise application project I work on I have to define the same basic standards for user interfaces.  Things that should be obvious but, it seems, aren't.

When an architect designs a building with brick wall there doesn't need to be a requirement that specifies that there needs to be morter between each brick to hold it in place.  Similarly, when an application needs to display numeric values, it shouldn't be necessary to specify that they should be right aligned.  Or if a list of values is presented for a user to select from, it shouldn't be necessary to specify tha they are sorted alphabetically.

This repository is an attempt to capture a lot of the basics, to act as a reference so that I can point development teams at this rather than have to write the same damn requirements again ang again.
